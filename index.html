                    Hi, I'm Emmanuel Lundenge, a passionate web developer with experience in creating responsive and user-friendly 
                    websites. I love combining creativity with technical skills to build engaging digital experiences. 
                    My expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. 
                    I'm also deeply interested in robotics and artificial intelligence, actively exploring these fields 
                    through RAICA's playground, where I experiment with AI-driven solutions and robotics simulations 
                    to create innovative applications. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, push the boundaries of 
                    web development, and integrate cutting-edge AI and robotics concepts into my projects to enhance 
                    functionality and user engagement.

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence(AI)</h3>
                <p>The goal of the RAICA curriculum is computational action with artificial intelligence for late primary, 
                    middle and secondary students. In order for students to take computational action with AI, RAICA has 
                    designed lessons that provide opportunities for students to apply computational thinking and responsible 
                    design while growing their AI fluency. We approach all of our work with a constructionist pedagogy, 
                    a belief that students learn best by constructing their own knowledge and being creative.</p>

                <h3>Robotics</h3>
                <p> Robotics for kids involves designing, building, and programming robots, blending coding, engineering, 
                    and creativity to teach STEM concepts through hands-on projects. It develops critical thinking, 
                    problem-solving, and teamwork skills as children learn from basic circuits to complex functions like 
                    obstacle avoidance. Resources range from age-specific kits like LEGO ® SPIKE™ Prime and Sphero to online 
                    classes and camps, providing engaging ways for kids to learn the fundamentals of robotics</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>Web development is the process of creating, maintaining, and managing websites and web applications that run online. 
                    It combines technical and creative skills to build everything from simple static pages to complex social media 
                    platforms and e-commerce sites. Key aspects include designing user interfaces, programming website functionality, 
                    managing databases, implementing security, and optimizing for performance and search engines</p>
